This project makes it possible for users to claim and curate from the SHARE repository

1- ORCID, users login with their ORCID ids. We make use of the ORCID API

2- Items are retrieved from the SHARE repostory

3- Users claim from the retrieved list of objects 

4- Users establish relations across claimed objects 

5- Users can export their metadata bundles as DISCOs or ROs
